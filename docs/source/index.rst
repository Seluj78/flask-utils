Welcome to Flask-Utils' documentation!
======================================

**Flask Utils** is a Python library that contains a bunch of useful utilities for Flask applications.

Why ?
-----

You might find the decorator `validate_params` quite similar to Pydantic, but I find that I don't enjoy the way Pydantic works and interacts with flask, and the way it handles errors. I wanted something more simple and more flask-like, without having to do a try-except block for every request.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
